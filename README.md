### Description
The Braille Keyboard is designed to assist blind individuals in accessing digital functionalities within their comfort zone. This keyboard takes input from touch sensors, and an Arduino program converts the input into English letters, which are then displayed on an LCD monitor.

### Features

- Real-time display on an LCD monitor.
  
### Items Used
1. **Arduino Uno R3**
2. **6 Touch Sensors**
3. **LCD Display**
4. **Breadboard**
5. **Jumper Wires**

### How It Works
- Each touch sensor corresponds to a different Braille dot.
